# Overview of Generative AI Usage in this Project

## Generative AI (ChatGPT 4o) has been used to do the following:
* Generate the StoryPath Logo featured in the header and favicon (same one from A2).
* To iterate and draft styles and layouts for the UI.
* Draft javascript comments, which were then manually verified and edited for accuracy.
* Write some inline comments, although most were written by myself.
* To give examples and help understand Javascript, React Native and Expo Go functions and how they would be used generally.
* To debug and modify code that I had tried to get working already myself.
